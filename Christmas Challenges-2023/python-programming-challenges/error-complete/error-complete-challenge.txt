Ok man, truuuuuust me when I say this, I'm a programmer! Yeah... but I can't program worth of anything. I made this file,
"error-complete-file.py" but it doesn't seem like it works. I just couldn't figure it out! Could you help me with this?

PS: look at its syntaxing (the ordered way programming languages want you to program) and make sure that everything seems
correct. Also, the use of debuggers and logs might help as well!
