Attention student, this is your principle speaking. I have a challenge for you and if you solve it, you get a 
$5,000,000 scholarship! I need you to make me a Python program that finds the total and difference amount of lines for the
text files "all-equals-grade-1.txt" and "all-equals-grade-2.txt"

For instance, if I have the files where "file1.txt" has 10 lines and "file2.txt" has 15 lines. Then the total of these two
is 25 lines and the difference is 5. That is your challenge!

PS: when doing this challenge, make sure you know how to read the content's of a file!
