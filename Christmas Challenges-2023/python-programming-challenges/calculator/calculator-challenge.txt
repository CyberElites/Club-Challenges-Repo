Hey there buddy! I need help with math. I want a calculator that can do some basic math for me because I'm pretty bad at it.
Could you program this calculator in Python? The calculator doesn't have to be complicated, just doing some multiplication,
division, addition, and subtraction.

PS: Don't make a graphical calculator, unless you want to; it can run inside of the terminal.
