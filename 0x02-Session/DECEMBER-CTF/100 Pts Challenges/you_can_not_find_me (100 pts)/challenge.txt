Agent 69420, you have been assigned to track the location of a highly dangerous individual.

Fortunately for us, he has shared a picture of him on his Twitter account that we have downloaded.
He believes we will not track him down, but he will be wrong. This a special mission, your orders
are to use the provided "osint.jpg" image and track down the location of this individual. We
need geolocational coordinates, so no street addresses or none of that nonesense. This will
be in latitude, longitutde and as an ordered pair

We will only accept a 0.0001 error margin in the coordinates given. So, for instance, if you give
the latitude coordinate of 12.1234 and the actual latitude coordinate of the individual is
12.1235, we will accept your answer. However, if your answer was 12.1230, we will not accept
your answer.

Good luck agent!
