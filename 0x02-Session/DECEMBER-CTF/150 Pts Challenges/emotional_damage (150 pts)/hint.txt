I will give you two hints.

1) If you cat the file in the terminal, you will notice that you get blocks. The reason for this is because
the terminal emulator we are using can not translate the data in the file to a human-readable format.
The reason for this is because of encoding regarding the UTF standard, unicode, and ASCII. You can
look up these buzz words on your own time since I will not be discussing them here. In order to view
the file properly, copy the file or the contents of the file into your browser.

2) I will not tell you much about this challenge since it will be too easy if I gave you too much information.
However, the only hint I will give to help you solve this challenge is for you to use and look up the 
"substitution cipher". Make sure to use online resources and websites when solving this challenge.
