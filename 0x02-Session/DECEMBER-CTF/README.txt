Use this README file to understand how this Capture the Flag (CTF) event works.

====
About #1
====

This CTF event has four main components:
  1. The goal of this compitition is to get the flag.
    - The flag can be either in a file called "flag.txt" or inside something like a file, program, image, etc.
    - You will know you have the flag when it looks something similar to "cyber{random_text}"
  2. Each challenge is inside a directory with a specific name and its corresponding points (pts) amount.
    - For instance, the directory "challenge #1 (50 pts)" has the challenge name "challenge #1" and is worth 50 points.
  3. Most of the challenges in this CTF event has hints.
    - These files will be called "hint.txt" and it will help you get started on the challenge and point you in the right
      directory to get the flag.
    - Note, most challenges will have hints, however, as you get to harder challenges worth more points, the hints will
      not be available and you have to use your skills to solve the challenge.
  4. Finally, when you complete a challenge and obtain the flag, ensure you give the flag to me. You can privately DM the
     flag to me on Discord (@<username>) or through my school Gmail (<email>). As long as the flags
     are not sent after 12/20/2024 11:59 PM CST, I will accept the flag and provide you your points.

About #2
====

This CTF event will last from 12/5/2024 to 12/20/2024. The competition is about who can solve the most challenges to earn
the most points. The two people with the highest amount of points will be chosen to be on my team and compete in the 2025
MOREnet competition in Columbia, MO. Also, the top 3 people will get a prize as well.

I want you guys to try your best and have fun while doing this. This is a great way to learn more about cybersecurity and
technology. Also, we will only be working on this competition a little bit on 12/5/2024 and on 12/20/2024. This means you
should work on this in your own time to ensure you outcompete the other people in the cyber club.

Finally, throughout the days until 12/20/2024, I will be posting new challenges with ranging difficulties. I will notify
everyone on Discord when I post new challenges. As of 12/20/2024, there are only 4 challenges.

Rules
====

This is a pretty open-resource and non-restrictive compeition. However, I will disqualify anyone who does the following:
  1. Sharing flags. DO NOT share flags with other people. If you share flags, you and the other person that got the flag will
     be disqualified from this compeition. I will resort to testing people's knowledge of the challenge if I suspect sharing
     of flags.
  2. Do not work with other people in the cyber club during this competition. If you work with someone else, I will deduct
     points for the first time. If it happens again, you will be disqualified.
  3. DO NOT sabotage other members in the competition. Doing so will be an automatic disqualification from the competition
     and a REMOVAL from the cybersecurity club. There will not be any exceptions. Do not intentially break or overload the
     cyber server, break into other member's computers or user accounts, or prevent access to other individuals.
