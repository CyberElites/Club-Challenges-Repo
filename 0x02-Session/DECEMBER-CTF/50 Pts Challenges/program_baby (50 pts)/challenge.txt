This challenge is simple and creaive. In this challenge, I will let you use any programming
language you would like to use (Python, Bash, Rust, R, Perl, C, C++, etc.) and you can write
any kind of program you would like.

However, I do have a few rules and guidelines:

1. The program must be longer than 15 lines of code.
2. The program must be unique and have some form of logic/purpose. This means your program
   should not be a Bash file and have 15 lines of the "echo" command running.
3. You should be able to execute and run the program on your system. That means, if you
   create a Rust program, you must be able to execute the Rust program.

Finally, once you have completed the above, you must send the file to me in a DM in Discord
or through gmail. Also, you have to provide evidence that you can execute the program.
