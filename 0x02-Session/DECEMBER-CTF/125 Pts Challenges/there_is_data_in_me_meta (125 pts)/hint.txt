Have you ever heard of "metadata"? Everytime you take a picture with your phone,
your phone's camera software stores special, additional information to the
image you took. For instance, this data could be where you took the file,
who took the file, and even what model phone you took the picture with.

This is called metadata and they are not excluded to just images. Other files
could have metadata too, but it is something a little different (e.g., attributes).
This kind of data is extremely useful for security experts, especially if they
have aphoto of some criminal and the metadata is still on it.

Look up more about metadata and how to analyze it!
