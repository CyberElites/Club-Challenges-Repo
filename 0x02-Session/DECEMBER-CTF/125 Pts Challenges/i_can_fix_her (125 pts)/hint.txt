This challenge involves "python.py" which is a python file. If you have some programming knowledge,
you know that you can run a python file using a python interpreter. Whenever you run the interpreter,
the python compiler will return any syntax errors that it encounted while executing the program to
your computer. Take note of these errors as they will help you correct the mistakes in the program.

If you have any trouble figuring out the syntax errors produced, you can look up the errors on
Google or on the StackOverflow forum and they will most likely be able to point you in the
right direction.
