Yo, dude...

I got realllly bunched up last night and I started programming in Python man.
The problem dude is that I can't make the thing run. I was like a computer wizard
man, making this program run and stuff. But now it doesn't work.

Could you help a homie out man?

Note, you do not have write permissions for the file. So, you will want to copy the
file into your home directory to edit. Once you have done that and fixed the program,
you can send the Python file to me in either a DM in Discord or through gmail
(<email>).
