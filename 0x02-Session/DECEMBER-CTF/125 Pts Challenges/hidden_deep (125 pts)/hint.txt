Do you know that you can hide files within files? If not, well, this is the main point of
this challenge. Flag.txt is hidden within coverup.jpg, and you have to figure out how to
extract it. I used a common steganography method (look up that word) to put the file
in the image. That's all of the hints I will give. Just remember these words: steg and hide.

Note: you will not have to install any tools as long as you are using the tools on the cyber
server. If you are on your own machine, you might have to install your own tools.

P.S.: No password ;)
