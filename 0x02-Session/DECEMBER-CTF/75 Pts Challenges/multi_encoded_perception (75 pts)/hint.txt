This challenge is about encoding plaintext data into an encoded text. This makes it unreadable by human
standards because we do not know what it reads.

To understand it, look up different kinds of encoding methods computers use. Also, look at the cyber
club's past lessons on the Discord.

Finally, instead of decoding the encoding by hand, you should also look up tools to help you decode
the encoding. Look at the tools and commands spreadsheet on Discord or Google "online tool to decode
encoded text" or something similar of that sort.
