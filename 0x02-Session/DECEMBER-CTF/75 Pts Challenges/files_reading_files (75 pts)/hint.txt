To solve this challenge, you want to go to billybob's home directory. Remember that all users are stored
on the /home directory. After going to his directory, go to the directory listed as the same name as this
challenge.

After going there, you will see three files. Billy Bob thinks that you can not read the "flag.txt" file,
but you can. Try looking at the other scripts and what they are all about. For instance, you will see
a "script.c" file. Look up what kind of file a ".c" file is. You will find out that it is a programming
language. Figure out the syntaxing or structure of this script.

You will need to understand what the "main()" function does. You will need to understand what the builtin
functions FILE, char, printf, scanf, fopen, and fclose does. I recommend, to learn more about C, look at
