Dear Hacker,

My name is Billy Bob and I have a directory on this system with the username "billybob". I want you
to go to my home directory and into the directory of this challenge. From there, you will see
some files. Good luck trying to read the flag.txt, I doubt you will be able to do that.

Ha ha, you suck.


Love,
Billy Bob
