There are a lot of words in the words.txt file. In fact, there are 466550 words in the file.
That's a lot and I doubt you want to go to each line of the file to find the flag text.

So, in order to complete this challenge, you will want to use a common command most Linux
distros have. Just remember this, you want to filter the text, so figure out how to do
that in the command line interface (CLI). Don't forget to use Google!!!
