This is going to be a harder challenge than the other ones as of 12/9/2024.


There are three things you are going to have to look up:

1) how to use a bruteforcer to break into an compressed file using a password.
2) using a "wordlist" to break into a compressed file.
	- If you figure this out, use a "rockyou.txt" file.

---

Three things to note from the above.

One, you will not have to install anything on your own physical system to complete this challenge.
Everything in this challenge can be completed on this server.

The other thing is that I would recommend using a wordlist instead of a bruteforcer since you will
probably be at it for a while, but it could potentially take about 2-10 minutes, depending on the
server's resources.

Final thing, this may all sound pretty foreign language, but that is fine. Try to research and
understand what to do and what the above terms mean. Look at public forums, readings, and 
other resources to figure this challenge out.
