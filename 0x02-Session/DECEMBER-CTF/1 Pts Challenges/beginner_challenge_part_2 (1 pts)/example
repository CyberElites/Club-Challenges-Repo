Example Text

---

The above text is the answer to this challenge. The "Example Text" is the answer. Even though it is not in the
traditional flag fromat "cyber{text}" it is still a solution. You will see this in some of the other challenges
that I will post throughout this competition.

For example, if I ask you the coordinates of something, the answer would be the x, y coordinates, not a flag solution.
