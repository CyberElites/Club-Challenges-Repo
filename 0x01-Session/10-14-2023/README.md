Existing encryption is dumb, so I came up with something better. Maybe it's a little emotional or whatever, but I feel like you can get through that part…

In the challenge, there is no punctuation and everything is lowercase alphabetical characters.

Hey man, I was given this file and it asks for a password. I tried reading the contents of it but it seems to be compiled already. Do you think you can decompile it and find the password?

Hey, punk! I stole your credit card information and you won't be able to find me. I even took a picture of my location because that's how confident I am that you won't find me! HA! Good Luck!

PS: the flag format will be cyber{xx.xxx, xx.xxx} for coordinates.

Hey there navigator, it's time to follow some directions. Take your challenge input (file) and start at the initial position, such as the below x=52, y=-31. Just like you are on a 2D graph, move in the direction the arrows tell you to. In the below example, you end up in the same x position for a difference of 0 and down one for a y difference of -1. Take your final position, in this case 52, -32, and multiply the values together–that is your final position. The answer to the sample prompt is -1664.

Sample prompt -
Initial Position: (52,-31)
↘ ↙ ↘ ↙ ↘ → ← ↖ ← ↗ ↘ ↑ ↑ ↓ ↗ ← → ↙ ↖ ↑

Final Position: (52,-32)

Answer: -1664
